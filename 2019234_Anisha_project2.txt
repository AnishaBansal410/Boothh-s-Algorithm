 DOCUMENTATION FILE :- BOOTH'S ALGORITHM

1.) INPUT:- 
 * n= no. of bits 
* md= multiplicand
* mr=multiplier
2.) INITIALIZATION:-
* A=0
*Q0=0
*Q=binary representation of mr
*MD=Binary representation of the multiplicand (md).
3.) OUTPUT:-
* Binary representation of multiplicand and multiplier.
* Table representing binary representation of A, Q and Q0 at each step of process.
* Binary representation of the final answer.
* Final answer in decimal. 
4.) ASSUMPTIONS:-
* No. of bits, i.e. , n is important as an input to specify the length of binary strings A, Q and MD and hence the range of multiplier and multiplicand. 
* Range of the Multiplier (mr) can be : -(2^(n-1)) to (2^(n-1)-1)
* Range of the Multiplicand(md) can be : -(2^(n-1)-1) to (2^(n-1)-1)
For ex:- for n=4, the range of md = (-7 to 7) and range of mr = (-8 to 7)
* All the integers in the given range are allowed.

Note :- The final answer in decimal is printed by converting the final binary represented output string (AQ) and not by simply           multiplying mr and md. 
          Therefore, it is verified that the output binary string is correct.
